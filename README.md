Comparison of different Machine Learning Algorithms
The dataset used here has been originally obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient is diabetic based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. All patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian Heritage. 

The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one Target Variable ‘Outcome’, i.e., whether the patient has diabetes or not. Predictor Variables include the Number of Pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, Insulin levels, Age, Glucose levels, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness and Diabetes Pedigree Function. 

This project aims at comparing different Machine Learning Classification algorithms, namely Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Logistic Regression based on their accuracy in classifying diffrent data points. 

It was found that Random Forest was the best classifier among the three.
